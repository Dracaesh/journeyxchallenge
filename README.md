Coding challenge code

The 'main.py' file contains all the logic necessary to handle the coding challenge prompt.

To test the message strings on this file, simply insert relevant messages in the "message_list" list within 'main.py'. The program's logic will run through each message sequentially and will output the desired JSON text into the resulting 'JSON_output.txt' file. This resulting file will be in the same directory as 'main.py'.
